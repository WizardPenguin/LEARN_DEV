starting with grid 

{
    display : grid;
}

.container>.item.item${Item $} { creates with class item itemi , with content item i}

by default they stack in column direction...... 
or it remains as it iss....


How to create columns as default is single column ::: 

gtc 

grid-template-column : 100px 200px 100px; 

{ browser auto adjusts number of rows (implicitly)}

we can also give percentage .... 

{gap : row_gap column_gap}
column-gap = 50px , and we set column size 50%, 50% ---- then it'll go out and we have extra gap... 
row-gap

so we uses flexible units ..... 
grid-template-column : 100px 1fr 1fr; 
        or 100 repeat(2,1fr) 

if some row/column created implicitly then they takes their default width to change it 

grid-auto-rows : 300px ; ..... so if rows not in template, then they auto gets 300px... 

grid-auto-flow : row ; // default value, so each element added as rows... meaning 
                    when things starts going out of width, then it auto goes to next row... and values are putted row wise.....


let's just say row-size if fixed using grid-auto-row : 100px 

then we can create column like 

grid-template-columns : repeat(auto-fill,200px) ----- as much as they can adjust but atlest 200px....

auto-fill ----- it auto creates extra columns, meaning if we give property to work with space, it won't help, as it has created element..
auto-fit ------ grid doesn't go to extra space, extra space not divided via grid, doesn't create extra columns


sometime when element can't fit in extra space it goes to next row, and space is :empty
to occupy that space we can changed widht of element meaning
repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr))   here we can analyse auto-fill, if we have less elements compared to whole width can occupy..



increasing span of our item ::::: 

layout--- show line numbers.... 

.item1 {
    grid-column-start : 1;
    grid-column-end : 3;
}

or 

grid-column : 1/3; ( here we give line number)
    : 1 span 2 ( this takes 2 items size, it doesn't matter going to which line)
    : span 2 ( does't matter from where it's starting, we have to give it span of 2)

taking whole span 

grid-column : 1 / -1 ( occupies whole columns doesn't matter of numbers ininreases or decreases)

but if someone in middle is increase like this, then it might cause empty spaces in upper ones to deal with it 

grid-auto-flow : dense ( this algrithm moves items our of order is there is empty space and more elements to put there)



1st we need to move element inside a grid ( items)

justify-items :  / default it's streach (start,end, space-between, center)  work is done alnog x axis, meaning horizontal
align-items ;    / working on horizontal direction up/down y axis

place-items : align-items justify-items ; 



justify-content, align-content..... in case we have extra space outside grid lines, inside grid container

place-content : align-content justify-content;

 

align-self, justify-self ------> can be applied to indivisuals....
shorthand place-self. 


Grid template areas ::: 

in container : 

grid-template-areas : "header header"
    "content sidebar"
    "footer footer"

tell everyone which area they belongs to.. 

header {
    grid-area : header
}

footer {
    grid-area : footer;
}

aside {
    grid-area : sidebar;
}
    


now for reponsiveness... 

grid-template-areas : 
    "header"
    "content"
    "sidebar"
    "footer"



Image properties :

object-fit : cover
object-position : center/ top left /...

overflow : hidden;


debugging ::::: 
removing everything inside a box, so ew  can foxus on outside. 

.box > * {
  display: none;
}

remember : 
overflow : hidden ----> clips doesn't removes 
opacity = 0 -----> still cicable 
hieght: 0 ===> collapses whole box



grid-auto-flow : change direction of content movement
grid-template-columns : percentage or fr or pixels or auto( size of container or size of content in column)
grid-template-rows : 


row-gap and column-gap


{ grid-column-start grid-column-end} ------ we can event move elements in middle by starting them from some col and ending other.. 

grid-column-start : span <number>
