bootstrap - include it, it's a CSS enhancer
extension : HTML CSS Support

# container row column in grid system 

.conatiner ---> adds padding on screen automatically for it's data

it's made responsive for small,medium,small, extra larger, extra extra large.... etc screen sizes

container-md ---- if we set class to breakpoint 
others are container-fluid container-lg container-md container-sm container-xl container-xxl

then every size larger than that is going to have breakpoint property 
and every size below that is going to be fluid

## rows 


## sizing column
default column takes 1fr ---- equaly divided size
botstrap grid is based on 12 column spaces 

col-x ------> take size of x columns 
col-auto ----> make col just the size of content... 

if we don't specify breakpoint ----- then every screen size if going to have that ratio throught.. 

col-lg-4 --> on all screen sizes lg and above we want it to have 4 column space.
** larger size breakpoints overrrides default properties 
col-lg-4 col-8 ---> col 8 is now default but for lg above it's 4.
### if we don't give default value then going below larger will give it 12 column..

so we can add more breakpoint properties.. 


### overflow of column
things wraps around to next row... 

### ofsetting column
creating extra space of size of column before that particular column
offset-3 --> creates 3 col space beofre this element in col. ( it always count space from base line of previous element... in that row)


## row creation 

row-cols-2 ( creates 2 col for each row)

now elements inside them take their place in that grid.

we can still mannually specify size by using col-x 

row-cols-lg-4 ---- meaning after larger and above we need 4 cols each time.. 

default break1 break2..... is way to write.

## verticle gap.... 

gy-0...5  or gx-0...5
gap on y axis.... or x axis...

we can have them on break points too

gy-lg-2 .... etc


## nesting 

.container
    .row 
        .col
            .row ..... this is pattern always followed... tp breal col again into some cols




# formatting table using bootstrap... 

on top we can have table-responsive 
--- which automatically creates a scrool bar in case rows goes out of hand..
--- we can obviously give responsiveness based on screen sizes 
table-responsive-lg ---- breakpoint

.table ---- default spans like a container and give each rows and column good spacing 
        --- also creates a bottom border for each row 
.table-striped
.table-striped-column
.table-hover ----- whenver we go over some element it changes it's apperiance 
    .table-active --- will make default hover on on some element which i'ts iven

table-boardered
table-borderless

table-primary  ------ main blue color
table-secondary ----- gray color 
    -success -------- green
    -danger --------- red
    -warning -------- yellow   
    -info ----------- bluish green 
    -light 
    -dark 

these are coloring scemes we can give them to table row/col (tr/td)...

## table divider 
table-group-divider

finally we have a divider class that can only be give to thead or tbody
this helps create a dark line on top of that thing....


# forms 

<form>
    <label for='email'> Email </label>
    <input type="emai" id="email">
    <button> Submit </button>
<form>

we have input, lable which need to be given some properties... 

label.form-lable --- nice padded and on top of input
input.form-control ---- spans full size as that of container, to control we need grid, has focus effect etc.. 
    .form-control-sm ---- shrinks down size of input 
    .form-control-lg 
disabled --- property taken into account and it stops taking input due to bootstrap
value = 'something' readonly ------ makes it read only looks like form and doesn't allow input

readonly .form-control-plantext ---- if we want eact width hieght that of input, but a plain text


### color picker 
.form-control-color ---- will make valid input type = 'color'

### range 
.form-range ---- will take type = 'range' and doesn't combile with form-control


### select input 
<select> 
    <option> one <option>
    <option> tow </option>
</select>

select.form-select or form-select-sm .... 
works fine with disabled etc too... 

### checkboxes 
generally lable comes after in checkboxes

<div class = 'form-check'>
    <input type = 'checkbox' class = 'form-check-input' id = 'x'/>
    <lable for = 'x' class = 'form-check-lable'>
</div>

if we add div.form-switch  ---> converts checkbox to a switch 

if we have many div.form-check and want inline , add form-check-inline to all. 

## input group 
divides input into some parts with some values or other input or plane text ... disabled input etc in single row.. 

<lable for='text' class='form-label'> text </lable>
<div class = "input-group">
    <input type = 'text' id = 'text' class = 'form-control'>
    <!-- <input type = 'text' id = 'text2' class = 'fomr-control'>.....  -->
    <div class = 'input-group-text'> $ </div> --- takes just the size of text and pushed to right 
    // we have input-group-lg ... etc

    <input type = 'text' id = 'text' class = 'form-control'> --- inputs try to take equal space, and div's are given space they needed..
    <div class = 'input-group-text'> $ </div> --- takes just the size of text and pushed to right 

    can also add buttom 
    <buttom class = 'btn btn-primary> + </buttom> 
</div>


### floating lable 
lable must come after input 
input must have a placeholder value... 
when we start typing then lable goes smaller on top, and we start typing.. 

<div class = 'form-floating'>
    <input type = 'email' id = 'email' class = 'form-control' placeholder = 'place email here'> 
    <label for='email' class = 'form-label'> Email </label> // don't really need form-lable class here
</div> 


### form validation 

is-invalid 
is-valid 
..

default 
<form novalidate> ---- this is default behaviour 
when we click submit, it just says fill something in required nothing else.. 

we can override that default behaviour

<script> 
    const form = documen.querySelector('form')

    form.addEventListner('submit', e => {
        if(!form.checkValidity()) {
            e.preventDefault();
        }
        form.classList.add('was-validated'); // add this class to form... 
    })

</script>

then once we click on submit, it starts showing is form-validations... 
which automatically updates when we start writing input wrong/correct.... 

this is done so we don't show these validation automatically when we load form... 

### adding custom validation text , below label we can write div's for feedback 

<div class = 'invalid-feedback'> Invalid email </div>


# bootstrap components 

## button component 

button.btn.btn-primary/seconday....

we can also use them on anchor tags. 

a.btn.btn-primary... 

*** just as note if button need to be shown as link button.btn.btn-link... 

### sizes
btn-lg 
btn-small 

### versions of button 
btn-outline-secondary 

disabled ----- fades out button either give as class or as parameter. 

data-bs-toggle = 'button' ----- then it has button toggle feature, meaning property changes in toggle manner. 
this is a custom data attribute that allow to hook some properties with JS.

for screen reader we can give some properties like area... 

area-pressed = true , if we button.active as initial value.. 

### button group 
div.btn-group ---> makes groups similar to that of input group. 

or btn-group-vertical --> to stack them vertially.



# alerts 

<div class = 'alert alert-success' role = 'alert' > Alert </div>
role --- given for screen reader. 

## coloring alert 
.alert-dark .. etc danger/success

## dismissible alert 

<div class = 'alert aler-success alert-dismissible' role = 'alert'>
    Alert 
    <button class = 'btn-close' area-label='close' data-bs-dismiss = 'alert'> </button>
    // -dismiss so it knows we are closing a alert
</div>

## alert link 
<a class = 'alert-link' href = '#'> know more </a>  --- data inside alert text. 

## fade 
div.fade.show ---> default showing.. 


# card 

<div class = 'card' style = 'width : 300px'>
    <div class = 'card-header'> </div> // makes a section different from body ... etc...
    <img class = 'card-img-top' src = 'xx.png'>  // card-img-bottom // card
    <div class = 'card-body'> // it can be overlayed over image card-img-overlay and img with card-img only.
        div.card-title
        div.card-subtitle
        div.card-text..... 
            text.. 
    </div> 
    <div class = 'card-footer'> </div>
</div>

## card-group 
div.card-group
    div.card
        div.card-header... 
    div.card 
        div.card-header... 



# model 

<button class = 'btn btn-primary' data-bs-toggle='modal' data-bs-target = '#modal'> open </button>
// we have data-bs-toggle to chooose what to happen
// data-bs-target = selector to chose on what we want effect on. this is needed to be more specific. 

<div class = 'modal fade' class = 'modal'> // modal-xl 
    <div class = 'modal-dialog'>  // modal-dialog-centered modal-diaglog-scrollable modal-fullscreen
        <div class = 'modal-content'>
            .modeal-header
                <button class = 'btn-close' data-bs-dismiss = 'modal' data-bs-target = '#modal'>
            .modal-body 
            .modal-footer 
                <button class = 'btn btn-primary' data-bs-dismiss = 'modal'> close </button>

# collapse 

allows us to show and hide some components 

toggle type = collapse
and target = selector of component to collapse

<button class = 'btn btn-primary' data-bs-toggle = 'collapse' data-bs-target = '#row' aria-expanded = 'true' area-control='row'>

<div class = 'row show'> // row should already know it's expanded or collapsed add collapse/show class 
    <div class = 'col'>
        <div class = 'box'> </div>
    </div>
</div>

## if many elements shares same selector, we can collapse all them with single button


# navbar 

<nav class = 'navbar navbar-expand'> -- full screen navbar. 
    <div class = "continaer">
        <a href = "#" class = 'navbar-brand'> brand </a>
        <ul class = 'navbar-nav'>
            <li class = 'nav-item'>
                <a href = '#' class = 'nav-link active' area-page='current'> </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class = 'navbar-text'> random text </div> 
    </div>
</nav> 


like this we can create navbar with ICON and ITEMS, which can have active class to show it differently. 
        ** area page just set for active page. 
    
nav-link === active/disabled etc... 


## coloring navbar
    background = bg-dark 
    then we can also set navbar coloring for dark using 
    navbar-dark. 

## collapsing navbar 
if we remove navbar-expanded it's going to be shown in collapsed manner 
let's say we only want it expanded on md and above 
use  .navbar-expand-md

whole navbar-nav needed to be under collapse 

<button class = 'navbar-toggler' data-bs-toggle = 'collapse' data-bs-target = '#nav' area-controls = 'nav' area-label = 'expanded nav'>
    <span class = 'navbar-toggler-icon'>   </span>
<buttton>
<div class = 'navbar-collapse collapse' id = 'nav'>
    <ul class = 'navbar-nav'>
        ...
    </ul>
</div>

then going md and below auto hides navbar

# utility classes 
## color background/border/text

bg-dark/...etc 
text-white/light.... etc 

### auto background and text 
text-bg-dark ---- auto choose text works best for give background 

### opacity 
text-opacity-50
bg-opacity-5
opacity-40 === opacity of entire object 

### coloring link 
link-dark/danger .. etc


## stacking objects together.. 

.hstack 
.vstack 

avoids using flex explicitly, we can directly move object like this.. 


## border utilities. 
border ---- first add border then changes it's properties... / border-top / border-start
border-primary 
border-5 ---- border size... 
rounded / rounded-3 / rounded-5 / rounded-pill / rounded-circle / rounded-top / rounded-bottom 
border-opacity-40


## changing display 
d-block d-lg-none ## hiding on >= larger screen sizes. otherwise block.. 

d-lg-flex .... etc.. 


## padding 
p-1 p-4 .... p-0

pt-1 --- padding top /ps for start / pb / pe 

## margin 
similarly larging 

mg-lg-5 ---- use 5 margin on screen lg or above... 
m-auto ----- use auto margin on all side 
me-auto ---- end margin is auto... 


## flexbox 
d-flex 
justify-content-center / start / between / around 

align-items-center / streach / 

flex-no-wrap 
flex-column 

### box 
align-self-center
