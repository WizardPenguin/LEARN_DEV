1. Anything on website it's structure and formatting is decided by HTML. ( not style color fonts concerned)
2. Formatting means : heading/italic, list, textbox, simply wireframe.

HTML tells rules to browser about how to present our plane text 
: Hyper text markup language


View Page Source -------> code of Page
Inspect ------> ?
shortcut to nevigate out of tags -----> lt + Shift + Right

HTML Elements 
    --- standard elements which broser recognises ( paragraph, heading, image)
    --- These elements are shown using tags

Tags are containers for < content > ----> which can contain image, text etc.... a box kind of thing.

[Tag Content /Tag] -----> makes a element

what is extension of file and it's usage ---> ?


HTML creates web page --- note website ( included many pages, frontent backend, databases etc)

Paragraph element ---> used to display collection of content together ( text images ), single line. ( extra space or extra lines are ignored)

Heading elements ---> <h1> < largest heading> ... <h6> ( smallest heading) ( every heading has their predefined default sizes)


#### boiler plate code   ### shortcut write ! ---- this is done via emits in vs code.
#### indentation < proper spacing >
standard or skelton or writing some code.
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tells about html version -->
<html> <!-- root tag -->
    <head> <!-- meta info or extra info like linking CSS or linking JS or extra info that is not displayed but needed -->
        <title> page title </title> <!-- name of page, this is not displayed on page, but in tab, also google uses this for search query -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> hello </p>
    </body>
</html>



#### list element 
# unordered ( bulleted)  ordered ( numbering )

<ul> for list and then add items to listusing <li> 
<ol type = 'A'/'a'/> for ordered list and adding item using <li>

##### HTML attributes 

attributes are used to add more information to tag.
eg <html lang='en'> -----> lang is attribute tells language is english
----- attributes elements can be in single or double quotes


Anchor elements
----> links using which we can move to some other part in page, some other page, some other site etc
<a href='location to go' > Google </a>
href ---> hyper link reference

https -> protocol   www -> search on world wide web 

we can give 2 type of links ---> absolute links or relative links. 




Image elements 

------ linking image to html pages 
------ this is a single tag meaning it has no closing tag als <br> <hr>  these tags don't have content part.

<img src='image path' alt="random_image" height = '10px' width = '20px'> 

src ---> relative or absolute path 
alt ---> in case image loading fails we show this alternate path.


As html doesn't add extra lines in doc, we need extra space, for that we uses 
<br> ------> line break , thi has no closing tag


Text highlighters 

<b> </b>
<i> </i>
<u> </b>


Comments in HTML, things inside comments are not executed to affect HTML doc, meaing part which is not parsed

<!-- comment -->


HTML IS NON CASE SENSITIVE meaning tags can be written in any case

Cateogry of HTML elements : 

inline/block elements

block elements ----> elements that occupies wholw width whenever they are used
     ----> occupy whole width irrespective of their actual width
     ----> they starts from new line

Inline elements -----> takes only necessary width
    -----> doesn't start from new line


eg : 
Heading ---> block element
Paragraph --> block element ( also used if we want 3 things in line, we uses 3 paragraphs they'll come in 3 different lines)
            ---> that way we can avoid using <br>
Anchor -----> Inline element --> takes space only what it needs
Image ---> Inline element --> only takes what required, it can be used in something like adding picture within text as it's inline.



Div element -------------- content division elements
    ---- doesn't have any functionality, just used a container to combine different elements,
    ---- it's a block element

------ so classifying things in a row, or making new line after some collection, div can be used.


Span elements 
    ------- similar to div element, group together things, and also have no functinality of their own
    ------- it's a inline element

HR --- horizonal rule tag

    ---- just a ruler line, single tag no opening closing, it is visible instead br just adds line without any visible thing

Sub & Sup tags
  ---- creating subscript and super scripts inside text, just a text beautification tag like bold/italic/underline






Semantic markup tags : 
it is the markup that relates to the meaning of content 

eg h1 ---> tells we have heading, or <img> tells we have image
but incase of <div> <span> are something which are not having meaning to them.
we have more sementic tags like <header> <footer> ---> these tags are similar to div, but they give more sementic meaning to tags


----- makes code more meaningful and layout more structured
----- makes it SEO friendly, search engine optimisation.
----- makes code redable, for people who are using screen reader

by default : we makes single header/main/footer/nav in our website
---- also they don't have any properties associated with them.

<header> --- top part of our website
<main>      
<footer> ---- contacts  or some important links etc are added using this
<nav> ---- used for navigation, meaning if we are going to add some webpage in our page, we uses nav tag.
<article> --- 
<section> -- to group together related content ( it's just more sementic that div tag)
<aside> --> linking some thing which are not directly related to our website 
        --> indirectly related things
        --> browser knows this is not main content of our website, but indicrectly related



HTML entities : 

eg &lt --> used for < symbol.
    html doesn't allow multiple spaces ( coverted to single space only) instead use &nbsp ( non breaking space)

pice of text -> start with & -> and ends iwth ;

used to display reserved characters ( which would otherwise be interpreted as html code), and invisible characters ( non-breaking space)

can lso be used to write characters which can't be written using keyboard etc &hearts;

Browser intreprets them, & render correct character 
eg &amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; 
entity names ---> lt, gt, amp etc...

Each of these characters have their unicode , using unicode we can display &&#9733; ---> represents *.


EMMET : 
sets of related plugins
essential toolkit for web-deveoper 
----> eg ! + enter ====== will generate boilerplate HTML code.


check docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet 

representing child using > 
meaning p->div , creates paragraph and div inside it.

sibling using + 
    p + div creates 2 tags 

climbing up 
    div+div>p>span+em^bq

Multiplication creating some element many times
li*5


A Bit more understanding of HTML5

HTML5 is collection of modern web technologies
this includes HTML living standard , along with JS APIs to enhance storage, multimedia and hardware access

HTML works via
HTML standards, which is a document that tells browser how HTML should work.

it's a living standard, meaning it changes time to time.



HTML tables 
eg--- attendance table etc...

characterstics of table ---- rows/colms
------------> such lines are called row1
------------> row2 

Table has header ( headings of columns)

<table>
    <caption> Table Caption </caption>  ---- or it's a table title, or photo text that describes what is photo about
    <tr>
        <th> head1 </th> ( single cell meaing 1 row and 1 colm)
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td> data1 </td>
    </tr>

so we mostly need <tr> tag, then td/th tags


sementic tags in table

<thead> ----> wraps table header
<tbody> ----> wraps table body
<tfoot> ----> wraps table footer ( eg when we are calculting some sum/average etc results)



colspan & rwospan
span meaning how many rows/column a cell going to occupy
default span = 1row 1col



Forms in HTML : 
to take user data and submit it somewhere

<form action=? > ----- action tells where to send data from form.

form has contents ------ Input/Select/Buttom/Textarea etc....

<input /> --- it's a single tag no open and close

<input type = "text/number/check-box/date/time/color...etc" placeholder="" name = "" value="default value">

text ---> to write text
number ---> also shows up/down buttom, and only take digits
date/time/color/image/password --> it also gives us input box where we can easily fill values by choosing from them
** without name nothing will be sent when we click on submit
** Name is used to identify for which are we going to give data.

placeholder --> text which is shown before entering value, and disapperas when we start writing in that input. 

**** lables ---- used as for captions some elements.
let's say we want to attach it to some input

ways to attach : 
<lable>

<input /> 

</lable>

2nd way to attach classical approach : 

<input type='text' id="unique for each element given by us" >
<lable for = "id given to input to which we want to attach it"> lable text </lable>



Buttom ------> to trigger some action

<buttom> text inside buttom </buttom>

any buttom created inside form by default behaves as submit button 
If button outside form, then we have to explicity assign some action to them.
also if we assign it a submit type, it won't be able to do something as don't know what to submit etc.

type in buttom -> "submit"/"button ( meaning do nothing but look button)"/"rest"


Button using input element ----> not advisable

<input type='submit/button/reset'/>  ---> shows some button, but nothing written there
when type = submit ---> it auto shows text/value=submit
value---- will give a default value also work for button



Name --- when we submit it sennds name=value? attributes to server or any link passed as action
this is inportant as without it it cant be sent over link


checkbox : they are ones which can be ticked and multiple at once are allowd

type = "checkbox" checked ---- to click it as default
type = 'radio' .....


<div>
    <input type = "radio" name = "fruit" id = "apple" >
        <lable for ="apple"> apple < /lable>
    
    <input type = "radio" name = "fruit" id = "banana" >
        <lable for ="banana"> banana < /lable>
since their name = "fruit" they are connected and only one can be clicked at a time.


but we don't have any value yet to identify/distinguish their click
so add a attribute value to them... as by default it will go like fruit = 'on'


if we do something similar with check-box 

they can be grouped meaning now many values can go under same name 
    like fruit=apple+banana?... like this



Dropdown --> created using select

<select name = "profession" id="profession>
    <option value="SDE" selected> Sofwtare enginer </option>
value is what passed on link
we can have some option selected

min/max will act as value attribute here, if not specified nothing goes to server
<input type = 'range' min='0' max='100' step='10'>



text_area 
<lable for='text"> text area <lable>
<textarea id = "text" name = feedback rows="?" cols = "?" >




css --- cascading style sheets ( a doc for styling)
text color background color etc.... properties


format : 
we have a selector : h1 ( anything with h1 tag wiould get this properties)
Property ---> which thing to be changed
value ----> to what value property to be changed 
semicolor --> terminator should be there 


h1 { 
    color:red;
}

Including CSS inside HTMl.

1. inline styling

*** check if all heading changes color 
<h1 style="color"red"> example </h1>

2. using Style Tag inside head or explore
used to get CSS for single HTML tag 

<style>
    h1 {
        color:red;
    }
</style>

3. external style sheet
    can be included in many HTML files 

we uses link tag in HEAD ( explore only in head or not)

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" ref="style.css">
</head>


properties : : : : : : 

1. color ---> this is to set foreground color ( meaning thing that looks inside a element, extra speace except that is marked a background)
2. background-color ---> 
3. background ----> can also set color but with more features like including imgae in background.


color system in CSS : 
1. named color : eg black,blue ( around 140 named colors are there)
2. RGB color system : rgb(0,255,0) 
3. Hexadecimal color system : #ffffff ( same as rgb but we write in hex) , short form to write is 0f0 ---- 00ff00


text properties : 
text-align : left/right/centering text in a element ( aligns us in accordance to parent), default (left align) 
            in first version (left/right/center was there)
            in latest CSS3 ---> new were start/end were added similar to left/right but they are language dependent
        Justify ------ meaning increase spaces between text to get them horizontally aligned

font-weight : bolding/lightering
        100-900
        normal value = 400, it can also be set using text normal.
        bold -- 700
        bolder and lighter used in relation with parent
        based on outer element we increase/decrease current elements font weight 


text-decoration : underline, overline, linethrough
    apperiance of decorative lines in text
    text-decoration-color ---------- either separate or <red underline>
    text-decoration-style ------ solid/wavy/dotted/double underline red

    set it to none to delete everything, then we can write our own


line-height : distance between rows of text
    controls hight of line of text
    eg normal
    or 2.5 ----> meaning 2.5 time normal.

we have other types also where we write in nm, or pixels etc


letter-spacing : space between letters
    px -> pixels is unit for letter spacing 
    letter-spacing=10px  or normal. 


font-size : size of font in CSS
units
    1 inch has 96 pixels 
    absolute : px ---- not suitable for responsive websites 
               pt pc cm mm in
    relative :  %  -------
                em ------- current sizes relation
                rem ----- parent size relation

font family : 
    times new roman --- general format
    specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names
    avant garde, arial, 
    cssfontstack.com 
    families -> serif sans-serif fantacy etc...



Selector : 

universal selector === *
element selector === h1,h2 {}

ID selector === #ID_NAME 
-- ids are case SENSITIVE
-- advisable to keeep ID's unique

Class selector === give a class attribute to a element, multiple classes can also be given
give some properties to class
and add this class to HTML element, so it inherits that property

we can give them to multiple different type of element, so no restiction on having same type of elements
.class {
    property=value;
}


descendents selector ----- never looks for direct child it can be at any level child

given by space 

div p {
    meaning only p with div as parent
    p inside div only.
}

Adjacent sybling combinator ( multiple selectors used in combination)
eg + (adjacent) 

all H3 which are immediately after p.

p + h3 { 

}

child combinator (>)

span > button 

meaning buttons inside span  

attribute selector :::::::::

input[attr='value']{

}

input[type] ---- input that have type in it


eg input of type text be colored in some way



question : div id = myid and all para inside it needed to be colored green 
class/id are attributes 

div[id='myid'] p { color = green;}

#myId p


Pseudo class ( a specific keyword/state added to element)
element:pseudoclass

: hover ---- coursor  moved over element

: active --- when clicked 

:checked --- for radio button or checkbox 

input[type='radio]:checked + label {
    change properties of label when input checked
}

.post:nth_of_type(2){ 2nd 
    background color changing : 
}

if we want all 2nd 4th ... etc from top, works among siblings of same type.
.post:nth_of_type(2n) {
    every even div's background changed 
}

pseudo elements ------- changing some specific part of element 

::pseudo-element ( single colon also workss)

::first-letter {
    changign tyling of first letter inside element.
}

::first-line 

::selection --- when portion selected then change property...


what is cascading---- algorithm of CSS that defined in which priority properties are applied.

things written in last is applied ( when selector is same)

if selector is not same ( we have a specificity algorithm) :

specificity value is a 3 digit number : 
100th place 10th place 1th place

eg : 

id class/attribute/pseudo-class pseudo-element/element 

their counts are calculated, so if Id used, 100th place makes lots of difference, so ID matters mostly

id > class > element 

h2 { 
    yellow; ------ 0 0 1(element + 0 pseudo element) ---- 001
}

.myClass:hover{
    yellow: ----- 0 (1 id + 1 pseudo-class) ---- 020
}

so more specific we are more chances of that property to be applied......

more selectors usage is considered better as it gives more priority......




Inline specificity ::::: 
when style is given inline meaning in HTML itself...... highest priority ( 1000th place)



!important ---- used to show/define most specific thing in CSS
this is importnat that inline style.... can't ever be changed after this
h2 {
    background-color: anitquewhite; !importnat;
}



Inheritence ::::
parent's properties goes to children side ( qualities ).

div -> p -> li 

if div background changed ----> then li's background also changes...


we can also explicitly write this
background_color : inherit; ---- then it takes background from parent 
input and button doesn't inherit, we need to write it explicitly....


some properties doesn't inherit by default 
eg width height border......


CSS box mode :::: 

h2 {
    border: 4px solid red; ---- to change border in inspect, click on it, and press up arrow to increase.
}
border-width, brder-style, border-color, border-bottom, border-top, border-radious 



+-----------------------------+
|         Margin             |   ← Outside spacing
+-----------------------------+
|         Border             |   ← Visible border edge
+-----------------------------+
|         Padding            |   ← Inner spacing
+-----------------------------+
|         Content            |   ← Text / image / element
+-----------------------------+

default : box-sizing: content-box; ------ width + padding(left&right) + border(left&right) + margin(left&right)

better : box-sizing: border-box; ---- width includes padding + border, just margins are extra spacing outside boundary kind.


padding ==== border<---> content
margin ==== border<----> outside world


values given like 

margin : all
margin : top/bottom left/right 
margin : top bottom left right....

margin : 20px auto; ( makes our element centered w.r.t left/right....) , gien we have a fixed width...


margin collapsing 

margin meaning elements tries to keep distance from each other, so if both have some marging and are near to each together
then mearging which is greater will be applied, simple..


*** inline elements : doesn't have top bottom margin,,,,,, they just have left right margin...
*** padding in inline elements can cross over other elements.... irrespective of other's margin etc.... overflow foud...
     left right paddings can be good....

    
converting elements inline<>block
display : inline/block....etc


Image tag ( inline block element....) margin and paddings all works good there..... no issue...

eg ... <a> is a inline element
margin top/bottom doesn't work, padding top/bottom causes overlapping..
There height and width are not controllable.....

if display:inline-block....

then we can give margin,border.... but they keep in same line....(unlike block elements..)


browser gies some default margin to body of 8px..... 
such default styles are given by browser how to reset them ? 

* {
    margin:0
    padding:0
    border-sizing:border-box;
}



UNITS : 
% ---- percentage of size of parent 
width = 33.3%
margin-left = 50% ( of size of parent.)
