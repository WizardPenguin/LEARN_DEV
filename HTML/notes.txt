1. Anything on website it's structure and formatting is decided by HTML. ( not style color fonts concerned)
2. Formatting means : heading/italic, list, textbox, simply wireframe.

HTML tells rules to browser about how to present our plane text 
: Hyper text markup language


View Page Source -------> code of Page
Inspect ------> ?
shortcut to nevigate out of tags -----> lt + Shift + Right

HTML Elements 
    --- standard elements which broser recognises ( paragraph, heading, image)
    --- These elements are shown using tags

Tags are containers for < content > ----> which can contain image, text etc.... a box kind of thing.

[Tag Content /Tag] -----> makes a element

what is extension of file and it's usage ---> ?


HTML creates web page --- note website ( included many pages, frontent backend, databases etc)

Paragraph element ---> used to display collection of content together ( text images ), single line. ( extra space or extra lines are ignored)

Heading elements ---> <h1> < largest heading> ... <h6> ( smallest heading) ( every heading has their predefined default sizes)


#### boiler plate code   ### shortcut write ! ---- this is done via emits in vs code.
#### indentation < proper spacing >
standard or skelton or writing some code.
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tells about html version -->
<html> <!-- root tag -->
    <head> <!-- meta info or extra info like linking CSS or linking JS or extra info that is not displayed but needed -->
        <title> page title </title> <!-- name of page, this is not displayed on page, but in tab, also google uses this for search query -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> hello </p>
    </body>
</html>



#### list element 
# unordered ( bulleted)  ordered ( numbering )

<ul> for list and then add items to listusing <li> 
<ol type = 'A'/'a'/> for ordered list and adding item using <li>

##### HTML attributes 

attributes are used to add more information to tag.
eg <html lang='en'> -----> lang is attribute tells language is english
----- attributes elements can be in single or double quotes


Anchor elements
----> links using which we can move to some other part in page, some other page, some other site etc
<a href='location to go' > Google </a>
href ---> hyper link reference

https -> protocol   www -> search on world wide web 

we can give 2 type of links ---> absolute links or relative links. 




Image elements 

------ linking image to html pages 
------ this is a single tag meaning it has no closing tag als <br> <hr>  these tags don't have content part.

<img src='image path' alt="random_image" height = '10px' width = '20px'> 

src ---> relative or absolute path 
alt ---> in case image loading fails we show this alternate path.


As html doesn't add extra lines in doc, we need extra space, for that we uses 
<br> ------> line break , thi has no closing tag


Text highlighters 

<b> </b>
<i> </i>
<u> </b>


Comments in HTML, things inside comments are not executed to affect HTML doc, meaing part which is not parsed

<!-- comment -->


HTML IS NON CASE SENSITIVE meaning tags can be written in any case

Cateogry of HTML elements : 

inline/block elements

block elements ----> elements that occupies wholw width whenever they are used
     ----> occupy whole width irrespective of their actual width
     ----> they starts from new line

Inline elements -----> takes only necessary width
    -----> doesn't start from new line


eg : 
Heading ---> block element
Paragraph --> block element ( also used if we want 3 things in line, we uses 3 paragraphs they'll come in 3 different lines)
            ---> that way we can avoid using <br>
Anchor -----> Inline element --> takes space only what it needs
Image ---> Inline element --> only takes what required, it can be used in something like adding picture within text as it's inline.



Div element -------------- content division elements
    ---- doesn't have any functionality, just used a container to combine different elements,
    ---- it's a block element

------ so classifying things in a row, or making new line after some collection, div can be used.


Span elements 
    ------- similar to div element, group together things, and also have no functinality of their own
    ------- it's a inline element

HR --- horizonal rule tag

    ---- just a ruler line, single tag no opening closing, it is visible instead br just adds line without any visible thing

Sub & Sup tags
  ---- creating subscript and super scripts inside text, just a text beautification tag like bold/italic/underline






Semantic markup tags : 
it is the markup that relates to the meaning of content 

eg h1 ---> tells we have heading, or <img> tells we have image
but incase of <div> <span> are something which are not having meaning to them.
we have more sementic tags like <header> <footer> ---> these tags are similar to div, but they give more sementic meaning to tags


----- makes code more meaningful and layout more structured
----- makes it SEO friendly, search engine optimisation.
----- makes code redable, for people who are using screen reader

by default : we makes single header/main/footer/nav in our website
---- also they don't have any properties associated with them.

<header> --- top part of our website
<main>      
<footer> ---- contacts  or some important links etc are added using this
<nav> ---- used for navigation, meaning if we are going to add some webpage in our page, we uses nav tag.
<article> --- 
<section> -- to group together related content ( it's just more sementic that div tag)
<aside> --> linking some thing which are not directly related to our website 
        --> indirectly related things
        --> browser knows this is not main content of our website, but indicrectly related



HTML entities : 

eg &lt --> used for < symbol.
    html doesn't allow multiple spaces ( coverted to single space only) instead use &nbsp ( non breaking space)

pice of text -> start with & -> and ends iwth ;

used to display reserved characters ( which would otherwise be interpreted as html code), and invisible characters ( non-breaking space)

can lso be used to write characters which can't be written using keyboard etc &hearts;

Browser intreprets them, & render correct character 
eg &amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; 
entity names ---> lt, gt, amp etc...

Each of these characters have their unicode , using unicode we can display &&#9733; ---> represents *.


EMMET : 
sets of related plugins
essential toolkit for web-deveoper 
----> eg ! + enter ====== will generate boilerplate HTML code.


check docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet 

representing child using > 
meaning p->div , creates paragraph and div inside it.

sibling using + 
    p + div creates 2 tags 

climbing up 
    div+div>p>span+em^bq

Multiplication creating some element many times
li*5


A Bit more understanding of HTML5

HTML5 is collection of modern web technologies
this includes HTML living standard , along with JS APIs to enhance storage, multimedia and hardware access

HTML works via
HTML standards, which is a document that tells browser how HTML should work.

it's a living standard, meaning it changes time to time.



HTML tables 
eg--- attendance table etc...

characterstics of table ---- rows/colms
------------> such lines are called row1
------------> row2 

Table has header ( headings of columns)

<table>
    <caption> Table Caption </caption>  ---- or it's a table title, or photo text that describes what is photo about
    <tr>
        <th> head1 </th> ( single cell meaing 1 row and 1 colm)
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td> data1 </td>
    </tr>

so we mostly need <tr> tag, then td/th tags


sementic tags in table

<thead> ----> wraps table header
<tbody> ----> wraps table body
<tfoot> ----> wraps table footer ( eg when we are calculting some sum/average etc results)



colspan & rwospan
span meaning how many rows/column a cell going to occupy
default span = 1row 1col
