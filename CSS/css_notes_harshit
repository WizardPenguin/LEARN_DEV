1. how to take fonts 

fonts.google.com ----> select-style ----> embed ----> copy the link ----> paste in html file in head section
use that in CSS file,
or just directly import in CSS


font-size : 

default : 16px...
line-height : 
word-spacing : 
letter-spacing : 
font-weight : ( only those available which are downloaded from google fonts)


box model : 

border : top/bottom left/right type color 
    or : top right bottom left ( top clockwise)

padding : content vs border 
margin : border vs outside

margin collapse : when two margins meet, the larger margin is applied

display :

block level elements gets height width margin padding 

inline elements only get padding margin that too only left and right 

inline-block : behaves like inline but gets height width margin padding



specificity : !important > inline style > id > class > element

default styles which can be removed by unversal selector 
*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    box-sizing:border-box;
}

CSS inheritance : some properties are inherited by default like font-family color etc but some are not like margin padding border etc


box-sizing : content-box (default) vs border-box (includes padding and border in width and height)

pseudo-classes : hover active visited first-child last-child nth-child etc
specifices some state of element 


LVHA order is required....
:link ---- links that hasn't been visited 
:visited ----- when we have visited that link
:hover ---- going over link
:active ---- when link is clicked, can be used with anyting, so we can observe in button

pseudo-classes with input : 
:focus ---- when input box is selected
:checked ---- when checkbox or radio button is selected
:disabled ---- when input box is disabled
:enabled ---- when input box is enabled
:recquired ---- when input box is required ( this can be given in HTML, and similarly access in CSS)

:nth-child(n) ---- selects nth child of parent ( can be even odd etc too)
:first-child ---- selects first child of parent
:last-child ---- selects last child of parent   
:nth-of-type(n) ---- selects nth child of parent of same type
:first-of-type ---- selects first child of parent of same type

p:first_child --- selects p which is first child of parent( p should be first child)
p:first-of-type ---- selects first p of parent ( even if its not first child)
